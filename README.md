**Note that CSSR-Matlab is NOT an official distribution**. This program attempts to create a Matlab interface for CSSR.

Before using CSSR-Matlab, it is recommended to read documentations published in the CSSR official website http://www.bactra.org/CSSR. CSSR-Matlab is based on CSSR, the original algorithm CSSR is developed by [Cosma Shalizi](http://bactra.org/) and Kristina Klinkner. 

If you decide to use CSSR-Matlab, please appropriately cite the paper "Blind Construction of Optimal Nonlinear Recursive Predictors for Discrete Sequences",  [arXiv:cs/0406011 [cs.LG]](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0406011). 





## CSSR-Matlab Usage 

To run CSSR in Matlab, navigator to the directory of **CSSR-Matlab** and execute the following command

```matlab
out = runCSSR(alphabet, data, maxlength, ofilename, siglevel, test_mode)
```



#### Alphabet Set

`alphabet` is the char array which contains all **alphanumeric symbols** used in the input data stream.

**NOTE:** only support `0-9`, `A-Z` and `a-z`. Each character represents a single symbol emitted at a particular period by the process.

Correct Example: 

  * ```matlab
    alphabet = 'ABC';
    alphabet = 'AB'; % or alphabet = '01';
    ```

**Wrong Example** (`10` is not a single symbol) : 

  * ```matlab
    alphabet = '012345678910';
    ```



#### Dataset

`data` is a collection of sequences of symbols (each sequence represents a distinct time series generated from the same stochastic process). If `data` has multiple rows, multiple-line mode will be turned on automatically. Note that data can be the file name of a text stream. 

* ```matlab
  data = 'test1.txt'; % a text stream named 'test1.txt'
  data = {'01001110000111110011'}; % single-line 
  data = {'01111110111'; '01000010110'}; % multi-line and same length
  data = {'011110'; '000011111011010111011100110110'}; % multi-line but different length
  data = {'ABCBABABACCCABC'}; % use more than 2 characters (instead of binary representation)
  ```
  
* Inside the text file `test1.txt`, the content looks like 

   * If `test1.txt` has single line 

     ```
     ABBBBBABABABCCCCABABABCCBBAAABABABCCCBABA
     ```

   * If `test1.txt` has multiple lines 

     ```
     ABABABBABCCCAAABBCACACAB
     BABABCBCBBCCBAAABA
     ABBABBABCACC
     ```



#### History Length 

`maxlength` is the maximum history length considered in causal states. For example, CSSR could recover the first-order Markov Chain from a discrete sequence when L is set to 1. It is important to investigate the correct order of the process. If history length is too large, the result of CSSR may diverge from the true solution. Read [CSS Parameters](https://github.com/randoruf/CSSR-Matlab#cssr-parameters) for more details. 

* ```matlab
  maxlength = 5; 
  ```



#### Output Name

`ofilename` CSSR-Matlab will rename files generated by CSSR. To understand what these output files represent,  please refer to the official CSSR depository <https://github.com/stites/CSSR#3-usage>. 

* ```matlab
  % If using a relative path, files will be placed in the directory of the running script. 
  ofilename = 'cssr'; 
  
  % If using an absolute path, files will be placed in that directory. 
  ofilename = 'C:\Users\????\Desktop\cssr'
  % Note that the current path is 'C:\Users\massw\Desktop' since 'cssr' is the output filename specified by the user.
  ```



#### Significance Level

`siglevel` is the significance level in range from 0 to 1, which is the probability of mistakenly splitting a state. This parameter is 0.001 by default. 

* ```matlab
  siglevel = 0.001;
  ```

* `test_mode` is optional, `'ks'` by default. If `'ch'` flag is set , use Chi-Squared significance test to split causal states instead of the default Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. 

  * ```matlab
    test_mode = 'ks'; 
    test_mode = 'ch'; % NOT RECOMMENDED
    ```

***Note***: **using 'ch' may lead Matlab to crash**. This is a known bug in the function taken from *Numerical Recipes in C*. Try to evaluate the command again if failing.  



## Example usage

```matlab
% add CSSR-Matlab to the path, "C:\Users\????\Documents\MATLAB\CSSR-Matlab" in my case.
if exist('runCSSR', 'file') ~= 2
    cssr_path = fullfile(userpath, 'CSSR-Matlab'); 
    addpath(cssr_path);
end 

% YOUR CODE HERE
% turn on multi-line mode automatically, significance level as 0.001, use 'ks' as test mode, and generate files named 'cssr' by default
out = runCSSR('ABC', {'ABABABCCCCBABABC'; 'ABABABCCCA'; 'BABBBACACACCB'}, 3);
```

The output `out` is a structure which includes fields `out.Cmu`, `out.state_prob` and `out.state_series`. 

* `out.Cmu` the statistical complexity. 
* `out.state_prob` the stationary probability distribution of each causal states. 
* `out.state_series` the series of causal states in the data.

## CSSR-Matlab Installation 

To install, download or clone from Github. Move all extracted files to a folder and add this folder to **Matlab path** (either by `addpath` function or `Set Path` button). 

Once all files are ready, [link C++ compiler with Matlab](https://au.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/choose-c-or-c-compilers.html) and run `makeCSSR.m` to compiles *mex* binaries at the first time. 

The recommended C++ compilers on different environments,  

| Operating System | C++ Compiler                            |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Windows          | *Microsoft Visual C++* or *MinGW C/C++* |
| MacOS            | *Xcode*                                 |
| Linux            | *GCC C/C++*                             |

Further details about compilers can be viewed [here](https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/supported-compilers.html). (Linux usually uses a newer version of GCC while Matlab only supports out-of-date GCC compilers. It is safe to ignore the warnings because GCC will take care of older code.)



## CSSR Known Issues

Due to the limitations in the original C++ implementation, there are a few known issues in CSSR. For more details, see https://github.com/stites/CSSR#5-known-issues. 



## CSSR Parameters

One common question when using CSSR for the first time is how to choose the **history length** and **significance level**. It is important to "tune" these two parameters which may affect the stability/accuracy of CSSR. 

**Suggestions: ** 

> exploring the data at low L and high s initially, and then increasing L and lowering s. If a stable architecture is found, it should be recorded at the lowest possible L.

To converge to a true epsilon machine, make sure the history length L is longer than true Markov order M (e.g. **L >= M**), otherwise, the number of states returned **may be incorrect** (less or higher than the actual one). 

However, for a fixed-length N data stream, if keep increasing history length L further than the true Markov order, **there is generally "blow up"** in the number of states (diverge from the true solution).  

For more details, please see https://github.com/stites/CSSR#4-some-suggestions-about-parameters.
